/**
 * This class is a simple loading screen for asychronous asset loading.
 *
 * This class will either create its own {@link AssetManager}, or it can be
 * assigned on. In the latter case, it needs a json file defining the assets
 * for the initial loading screen. In the former, the asset manager should
 * come preloaded with these assets. To properly display to the screen,
 * these assets must include a {@link scene2::SceneNode} named "load". This
 * node must have at least four children:
 *
 *     - "load.before": The scene to display while loading is in progress
 *     - "load.after": The scene to display when the loading is complete
 *     - "load.bar": A {@link ProgressBar} for showing the loading progress
 *     - "load.play" A play {@link Button} for the user to start the game
 *
 * When the play button is pressed, this scene is deactivated, indicating to
 * the application that it is time to switch scenes.
 *
 * In addition to these assets, the loading scene will take the take of an
 * asset directory. This is a JSON file defining the assets that should be
 * loaded asynchronously by this loading scene. Accessing the asset manager
 * with {@link #getAssetManager} gives access to these assets.
