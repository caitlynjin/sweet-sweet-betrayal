# Sweet, Sweet Betrayal

This is a game created during Cornell's class, CS 4152: Advanced Topics in Computer Game Architecture.

Gameplay Prototype notes:
- You must run the cugl build command (similar to programming labs) in order to build the game: `python cugl sweet-sweet-betrayal`
- The wind gust item is currently a work in progress and is not functional (it does not currently move the player upwards in Play mode, but it can be placed in the Build mode). This item appears with a blue circle and white upwards arrow.
