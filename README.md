# Sweet, Sweet Betrayal

This is a game created during Cornell's class, CS 4152: Advanced Topics in Computer Game Architecture.

## Set Up Instructions

You must run the following command in the directory outside the `sweet-sweet-betrayal` directory (similar to programming labs) in order to create the build folder:

```
python cugl sweet-sweet-betrayal
```


## Gameplay Prototype Notes

- The wind gust item is currently a work in progress and is not functional (it does not currently move the player upwards in Play mode, but it can be placed in the Build mode). This item appears with a blue circle and white upwards arrow.
